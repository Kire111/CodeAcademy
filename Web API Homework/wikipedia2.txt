The virus is transmitted by the faecal-oral route. It infects and damages the cells that line the small intestine and causes gastroenteritis (which is often called "stomach flu" despite having no relation to influenza). Although rotavirus was discovered in 1973 by Ruth Bishop and her colleagues by electron micrograph images[5] and accounts for approximately one third of hospitalisations for severe diarrhoea in infants and children,[6] its importance has historically been underestimated within the public health community, particularly in developing countries.[7] In addition to its impact on human health, rotavirus also infects other animals, and is a pathogen of livestock.[8]
