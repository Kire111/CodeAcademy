            <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
            Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit and millions already have.
            Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by acting as a widely accessible and free encyc
            lopedia that contains information on all branches of knowledge. It is supported by the 
            Wikimedia Foundation and consists of freely editable content. The name "Wikipedia" is a
            blending of the words wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the 
            Hawaiian word wiki, meaning "quick") and encyclopedia. Wikipedia's articles provide links
            to guide readers to related pages with more information.
            Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers. Anyone with Internet
            access and in good standing can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in 
            limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
            Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown into the world's largest 
            reference website, attracting 1.7 billion unique-device visitors monthly as of November
            2021. It currently has more than fifty-nine million articles in more than 300 languages,
            including 6,537,695 articles in English with 114,065 active contributors in the past month.
            The fundamental principles of Wikipedia are summarized in its five pillars. 
            Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers. Anyone with Internet
            access and in good standing can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in 
            limited cases.

            <h2>Facebook</h2>
            Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms.
            Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, 
            Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often
            given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually 
            expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, 
            Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active users,[2] and ranked fourth in global internet usage.[6]
            It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[7]
            Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets 
            and smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. 
            They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be 
            their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with
            each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the
            activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.
            The subject of numerous controversies, Facebook has often been criticized over issues such as user privacy
            (as with the Cambridge Analytica data scandal), political manipulation (as with the 2016 U.S. elections)

            <h2>TikTok</h2>
            TikTok, known in China as Douyin (Chinese: 抖音; pinyin: Dǒuyīn), is a short-form video hosting service
            owned by Chinese company ByteDance.[4] It hosts a variety of short-form user videos, from genres like 
            pranks, stunts, tricks, jokes, dance, and entertainment[5][6] with durations from 15 seconds to ten 
            minutes.[7][8][9][10] TikTok is an international version of Douyin, which was originally released in
            the Chinese market in September 2016.[11] TikTok was launched in 2017 for iOS and Android in most 
            markets outside of mainland China; however, it became available worldwide only after merging with 
            another Chinese social media service, Musical.ly, on 2 August 2018.
            TikTok and Douyin have almost the same user interface but no access to each other's content. Their 
            servers are each based in the market where the respective app is available.[12] The two products are
            similar, but features are not identical. Douyin includes an in-video search feature that can search
            by people's faces for more videos of them and other features such as buying, booking hotels and
            making geo-tagged reviews.[13] Since its launch in 2016, TikTok and Douyin rapidly gained popularity
            in virtually all parts of the world.[14][15] TikTok surpassed 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide
            in October 2020.[16][17][18]
            Morning Consult ranked TikTok as the third fastest growing brand of 2020, after only Zoom and Peacock.
            [19] Cloudflare ranked TikTok as the most popular website of 2021.
